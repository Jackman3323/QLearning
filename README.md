What is Q Learning? What does the Q stand for (and what about the "Learning")?
Q learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the most desirable set of decisions to achieve a given outcome.
The Q stands for quality--learning the quality of certain decisions versus others
Learning obviously stands for machine learning which at this point is pretty self explanatory.
What is RL (Reinforcement Learning) and how does it relate to ML (Machine Learning)?
RL is a form of deep learning--progress by trial and error vs ML which is learning by pattern recognition
A set of states and a set of actions
By preforming actions, we move from state to state
The better the action is, the more of a reward the algorithm gets
The goal is to attain the highest reward possible
This relates to machine learning because it learns by favoring certain moves in order to gain more of a reward.
What does it mean for Q Learning to be "model-free"?
Model free is a Markov Decision Process that does not use the “reward function”. Instead, the trial and error becomes the reward function.
What, if anything, is Q Learning often used for? (If you find any cool projects or research relating to Q Learning, feel free to link them to me!)
Google’s DeepMind used it to play classic video games with the goal of achieving the highest score possible.
